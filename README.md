## üìÑ Description

This task focused on implementing a basic **machine learning model** using Python and the **scikit-learn** library. The objective was to choose a suitable classification problem and demonstrate a full workflow including preprocessing, training, prediction, and evaluation.

I selected a **spam detection** task using the publicly available **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**. The task was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook format for better interactivity and documentation. A **Naive Bayes classifier** was used, along with text vectorization to convert messages into numerical data.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.12
* **Libraries Used:**

  * `pandas` ‚Äì for data loading and manipulation
  * `scikit-learn` ‚Äì for vectorization, model training, and evaluation
  * `CountVectorizer` ‚Äì for converting text to feature vectors
* **Dataset:** SMS Spam Collection Dataset (loaded from a public URL)
* **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
* **Editor:** Visual Studio Code with Jupyter extension

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Summary

1. Loaded the dataset containing labeled SMS messages (`ham` or `spam`).
2. Cleaned and prepared the dataset by encoding labels as binary values.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`.
4. Applied `CountVectorizer` to convert raw text into numerical vectors.
5. Trained a `MultinomialNB` (Naive Bayes) classifier using the training data.
6. Evaluated the model using:

   * Accuracy score
   * Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

All steps were implemented within a single notebook file for clarity and demonstration purposes.

## üåç Real-World Applications

* **Email Filters:** Automatically label emails as spam or not.
* **SMS Gateways:** Filter promotional or phishing texts.
* **Content Moderation:** Detect toxic or unwanted messages.
* **Customer Service:** Categorize incoming queries into topics like support, billing, or complaints.

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

* Jupyter Notebook: `task_4_spam_detection.ipynb`
* No external dependencies beyond common Python libraries and internet access for the dataset
